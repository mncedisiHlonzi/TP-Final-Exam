    "Data Collection:\n",
    "First, I would collect employee feedback, which could come from surveys, open-ended responses, or reviews about the two-pot system. This feedback would typically contain information about their experience with the accessible and locked pots, concerns, or satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.\n",
    "Tokenization: Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "Stop Words Removal: Remove common words like \"and\", \"is\", \"the\" which don’t contribute to sentiment.\n",
    "Lemmatization/Stemming: Convert words to their base form\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Detection:\n",
    "Positive: Feedback that shows satisfaction or approval of the system (e.g., “I love how flexible the accessible pot is”).\n",
    "Negative: Feedback expressing dissatisfaction or concerns.\n",
    "Neutral: Feedback that does not convey strong emotions, possibly descriptive (e.g., “The system is functional”).\n",
    "One popular tool for this is VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) or TextBlob, which are both lexicon-based approaches. Alternatively, a supervised machine learning model like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes could be used if we had labeled training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorization:\n",
    "Positive if the feedback contains words such as \"flexible\", \"benefit\", \"happy\".\n",
    "Negative if the feedback includes words like \"restrictive\", \"concern\", \"frustrating\".\n",
    "Neutral for comments that do not express strong emotion, such as “The system was implemented last year.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Output and Insights:\n",
    "Positive Feedback: A percentage of employees might express satisfaction with the flexibility the accessible pot offers for emergencies.\n",
    "Negative Feedback: Some might be concerned about the restrictions on withdrawing or the sufficiency of the locked pot for retirement.\n",
    "Neutral Feedback: General observations about the system’s features without any emotional tone."

    "Rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Employee Data: This dataset contains individual-level information on user behavior within the two-pot system.\n",
    "Understanding Usage Patterns: Analyzing factors like screen_list, numscreens, and minigame can provide insights into employee engagement and potential areas of confusion.\n",
    "Relevance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting Withdrawals: Usage patterns might indicate financial distress or a need for liquidity, suggesting potential withdrawal behavior.\n",
    "Forecasting Savings Growth: Understanding employee engagement with financial tools can help assess their financial literacy and potential for making informed savings decisions.\n",
    "Combined Analysis:\n",
    "By combining these datasets, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how economic conditions and individual behavior interact within the two-pot system. This enables you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify Vulnerable Groups: Analyze which segments of the workforce are more likely to withdraw funds based on both economic indicators and individual behavior.\n",
    "Tailor Financial Advice: Provide targeted financial advice to employees based on their specific circumstances and the prevailing economic conditions.\n",
    "Inform Policy Decisions: Assess the effectiveness of the two-pot system and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "In conclusion, the combination of these datasets provides a strong foundation for analyzing employee behavior within the two-pot system. By considering both external economic factors and individual-level data, you can gain valuable insights to inform policy decisions and improve financial well-being.\n"
